# igv-client
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/athos/igv-client.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/athos/igv-client)

Clojure implementation of IGV client to control [IGV](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) via its [Port Commands](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/automation#PORTCOMMANDS)

## Installation

Add the following to your `:dependencies`:

```
[igv-client "0.1.0"]
```

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[igv-client.core :as igv])

(def client (igv/connect "127.0.0.1" 60151))
(igv/set-snapshot-dir! client "/path/to/snapshot/dir")

(igv/reset client)
(igv/load-file client "/path/to/your/input/file")
(igv/goto client "chr1" 123456)
(igv/collapse client)
(igv/snapshot client)
(.close client)

;; or you can also write the same thing with the threading macro:

(-> client
    igv/reset
    (igv/load-file "/path/to/your/input/file")
    (igv/goto "chr1" 123456)
    igv/collapse
    igv/snapshot
    .close)
```
